This is a modified version of Cracking-Siri by Applidium which caches iPhone 4S authorization data and writes it to a text file.

Requirements:

 -An iPhone 4S
 -A UNIX system (Linux, Mac)
 -Port 53 and Port 443 are open on your computer firewall and your router firewall (If you're doing this from your home PC)
 -Some general knowledge about computers.


To install all needed stuff for this to work, just run 'sudo ./install.sh' (no quotes)

If you already have all the stuff installed to run it, you can generate certificates by running:

./scripts/certs.sh

then once you've done that, install ca.crt to your device.

Then to run the auth grabber, its just 'sudo ./cache.sh' (no quotes)

All auth data is written to ./auths as acehosts0.txt, acehosts1.txt etc.

All credit goes down to Applidium for creating Cracking-Siri
